//Showing Creativity and Exceeding Requirements
//1- The user selects "Create New Goal" from the main menu and chooses "Negative Goal" in the goal types menu.
//2. The user then provides a name and description for the bad habit goal.
//3. The user also needs to specify the number of points that will be deducted when they fail to meet this goal. This amount is stored in the points variable.
//4. After creating the bad habit goal, it will appear in the list of goals available for the user.
//5. When the user selects the "Record Goal Event" option from the main menu, they will be prompted to choose which of the goals they want to record as unfulfilled.
//6. The system then subtracts the number of points specified in step 3 from the user's total score.
//7. It displays a message indicating that the user has lost points due to not meeting the bad habit goal.
// The "bad habit goals" functionality allows the user to track unwanted behaviors and receive penalties in the form of points when they fail to avoid those bad habits. 
//This feature can be useful for encouraging behavior changes and improving self-discipline.
